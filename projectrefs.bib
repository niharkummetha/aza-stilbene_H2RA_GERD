	abstract = {Background
Laparoscopic anti-reflux surgery has a failure rate of 10–20\%. We aimed to investigate whether a modification of Nissen fundoplication (MNF) may improve patients' outcome and reduce failure rate.
Materials \& methods
We prospectively compared 40 consecutive patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease who underwent anti-reflux surgery: 20 Nissen fundoplication (NF) and 20 the MNF approach. Eight cases in the MNF group needed redo surgery. The MNF consisted in suturing the esophagus to the diaphragmatic crura on each side by means of 4 non-absorbable stitches and in fixing the upper stitch of the valve to diaphragm. In case of clearly weak crura, a reinforcement with Ultrapro mesh was used. All patients were assessed before and after surgery using validated symptoms and quality of life (GERD-HRQL) questionnaires, manometry and 24-h impedance-pH monitoring, endoscopy and barium-swallow.
Results
Mortality and postoperative complications were nil. At a median follow-up of 36 months, no significant differences emerged between the MNF and NF group in terms of symptoms, GERD-HRQL scores, manometric findings, and impedance-pH features. Dysphagia was not reported by the MNF group, while it was quite common (20\% vs.0\%, p = ns) in the NF group. Anti-reflux surgery was successful in all patients in the MNF group, whereas two patients in the NF group presented a slipped wrap and one recurrent reflux; two of these cases required redo-surgery (10\% vs. 0\%, p = ns).
Conclusions
Our preliminary data demonstrated that the MNF is a safe and effective procedure. Further, it seems to reduce the failure rate associated to the surgical procedure.},

	abstract = {Description
The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with suspected extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease.
Methods
This article provides practical advice based on the available published evidence including that identified from recently published reviews from leading investigators in the field, prospective and population studies, clinical trials, and recent clinical guidelines and technical reviews. This best practice document is not based on a formal systematic review. The best practice advice as presented in this document applies to patients with symptoms or conditions suspected to be related to extraesophageal reflux (EER). This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations.
Best Practice Advice 1
Gastroenterologists should be aware of potential extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and should inquire about such disorders including laryngitis, chronic cough, asthma, and dental erosions in GERD patients to determine whether GERD may be a contributing factor to these conditions.
Best Practice Advice 2
Development of a multidisciplinary approach to extraesophageal (EER) manifestations is an important consideration because the conditions are often multifactorial, requiring input from non-gastroenterology (GI) specialties. Results from diagnostic testing (ie, bronchoscopy, thoracic imaging, laryngoscopy, etc) from non-GI disciplines should be taken into consideration when gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is considered as a cause for extraesophageal symptoms.
Best Practice Advice 3
Currently, there is no single diagnostic tool that can conclusively identify GER as the cause of EER symptoms. Determination of the contribution of GER to EER symptoms should be based on the global clinical impression derived from patients’ symptoms, response to GER therapy, and results of endoscopy and reflux testing.
Best Practice Advice 4
Consideration should be given toward diagnostic testing for reflux before initiation of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in patients with potential extraesophageal manifestations of GERD, but without typical GERD symptoms. Initial single-dose PPI trial, titrating up to twice daily in those with typical GERD symptoms, is reasonable.
Best Practice Advice 5
Symptom improvement of EER manifestations while on PPI therapy may result from mechanisms of action other than acid suppression and should not be regarded as confirmation for GERD.
Best Practice Advice 6
In patients with suspected extraesophageal manifestation of GERD who have failed one trial (up to 12 weeks) of PPI therapy, one should consider objective testing for pathologic GER, because additional trials of different PPIs are low yield.
Best Practice Advice 7
Initial testing to evaluate for reflux should be tailored to patients’ clinical presentation and can include upper endoscopy and ambulatory reflux monitoring studies of acid suppressive therapy.
Best Practice Advice 8
Testing can be considered for those with an established objective diagnosis of GERD who do not respond to high doses of acid suppression. Testing can include pH-impedance monitoring while on acid suppression to evaluate the role of ongoing acid or non-acid reflux.
Best Practice Advice 9
Alternative treatment methods to acid suppressive therapy (eg, lifestyle modifications, alginate-containing antacids, external upper esophageal sphincter compression device, cognitive-behavioral therapy, neuromodulators) may serve a role in management of EER symptoms.
Best Practice Advice 10
Shared decision-making should be performed before referral for anti-reflux surgery for EER when the patient has clear, objectively defined evidence of GERD. However, a lack of response to PPI therapy predicts lack of response to anti-reflux surgery and should be incorporated into the decision process.},

An estimated 30,000 devices have been implanted worldwide. Device removals and erosion are identified risks. The objective of this analysis is to explore the procedure evolution with an emphasis on the removals and associated characteristics that may guide future clinical practice. The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience and Ethicon’s complaint databases were queried for all surgical device explants since January 2013. Device unit sales were used to determine the rates. The endpoint was based upon the time from implant to explant. Explant and erosion rates were calculated at yearly intervals and the Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to measure the time to explant. Chi-square analyses were used to investigate the risk of explant associated with the size, geography and implant year. Overall, 7-year cumulative risk of removal was 4.81\% (95\% Confidence Interval (CI) CI: 4.31–5.36\%). The likelihood of removal was significantly related to the device size (P \&lt; 0.0001), with smaller sizes being more likely to be explanted. The primary reasons for device removal and relative percentages were dysphagia/odynophagia (47.9\%), persistent gastroesophageal reflux disease (20.5\%) and unknown/other (11.2\%). Overall, the 7-year cumulative risk of erosion was 0.28\% (95\% CI: 0.17–0.46\%). The average device size increased from 14.2 beads ± 1.0 in 2013 to 15.3 beads ± 1.2 in 2019 (P \&lt; 0.001). Surgical technique and perioperative management play an important role in the outcomes. Clinical practice changes since magnetic sphincter augmentation has been incorporated into clinical use are associated with improved outcomes and should be further characterized. Smaller device size is associated with increased removal and erosion rates.},

	abstract = {Background \& Aims
Transoral esophagogastric fundoplication (TF) can decrease or eliminate features of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in some patients whose symptoms persist despite proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. We performed a prospective, sham-controlled trial to determine if TF reduced troublesome regurgitation to a greater extent than PPIs in patients with GERD.
Methods
We screened 696 patients with troublesome regurgitation despite daily PPI use with 3 validated GERD-specific symptom scales, on and off PPIs. Those with at least troublesome regurgitation (based on the Montreal definition) on PPIs underwent barium swallow, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 48-hour esophageal pH monitoring (off PPIs), and high-resolution esophageal manometry analyses. Patients with GERD and hiatal hernias ≤2 cm were randomly assigned to groups that underwent TF and then received 6 months of placebo (n = 87), or sham surgery and 6 months of once- or twice-daily omeprazole (controls, n = 42). Patients were blinded to therapy during follow-up period and reassessed at 2, 12, and 26 weeks. At 6 months, patients underwent 48-hour esophageal pH monitoring and esophagogastroduodenoscopy.
Results
By intention-to-treat analysis, TF eliminated troublesome regurgitation in a larger proportion of patients (67\%) than PPIs (45\%) (P = .023). A larger proportion of controls had no response at 3 months (36\%) than subjects that received TF (11\%; P = .004). Control of esophageal pH improved after TF (mean 9.3\% before and 6.3\% after; P {\textless} .001), but not after sham surgery (mean 8.6\% before and 8.9\% after). Subjects from both groups who completed the protocol had similar reductions in GERD symptom scores. Severe complications were rare (3 subjects receiving TF and 1 receiving the sham surgery).
Conclusions
TF was an effective treatment for patients with GERD symptoms, particularly in those with persistent regurgitation despite PPI therapy, based on evaluation 6 months after the procedure. Clinicaltrials.gov no: NCT01136980.},

Over-the-counter HRH2 blockers carry a five-membered aromatic heterocycle, with two of them additionally carrying a tertiary amine that decomposes to N-nitrosodimethylamine, a human carcinogen. To discover a novel HRH2 blocker scaffold to serve in the development of next-generation HRH2 blockers, we developed an HRH2-based sensor in yeast by linking human HRH2 activation to cell luminescence. We used the HRH2-based sensor to screen a 403-member anti-infection chemical library and identified three HRH2 blockers, chlorquinaldol, chloroxine, and broxyquinoline, all sharing an 8-hydroxyquinoline scaffold, which is not found among known HRH2 antagonists. Critically, we validate their HRH2-blocking ability in mammalian cells. Molecular docking suggests that the HRH2 blockers bind the histamine binding pocket and structure–activity data point toward these blockers acting as competitive antagonists. Chloroxine and broxyquinoline are antimicrobials that can be found in the gastrointestinal tract at concentrations that would block HRH2, thus likely modulating gastric acid secretion. Taken together, this work demonstrates the utility of GPCR-based sensors for rapid drug discovery applications, identifies a novel HRH2 blocker scaffold, and provides further evidence that antimicrobials not only target the human microbiota but also the human host.},

Findings from these patients were compared with data from 10 asymptomatic healthy volunteers. Recordings were obtained for 1 h in the fasting state and 3 h after a standard 850-kcal meal. Transient relaxation of the LES was the only mechanism of acid reflux in normal subjects and accounted for 73.0\% of the episodes of acid reflux in patients with GER disease. In both normal subjects and patients with GER, a large number of transient relaxations were associated at their onset with an attenuated submental EMG complex, a small pharyngeal contraction, and an esophageal contraction. The incidences of these associated events were similar in the two study populations. The frequency of transient relaxation of the LES in patients with GER was identical to that of controls. The frequency did not differ even in 9 patients with GER disease who had endoscopic esophagitis. Thirty-six percent of transient relaxations in the normal subjects were accompanied by pH evidence of reflux, but in the GER patients with endoscopic esophagitis 65\% of the transient LES relaxations resulted in a reflux event. Acid reflux at the moment of deep inspiration was the second most common mechanism of GER in our patients. Four patients who demonstrated this mechanism had hiatal hernias and more severe esophagitis than the rest of the group. Our findings confirm that transient relaxation of the LES is the major mechanism of GER in patients with reflux esophagitis. However, the similar frequency of this relaxation in GER patients and in healthy asymptomatic subjects suggests that factors other than transient LES relaxation play an important role in the pathogenesis of GER disease.},

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice on the integration of potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) in the clinical management of foregut disorders, specifically including gastroesophageal reflux disease, Helicobacter pylori infection, and peptic ulcer disease.
Methods
This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and CPU Committee to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert consensus opinion. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements
Best Practice Advice 1
Based on nonclinical factors (including cost, greater obstacles to obtaining medication, and fewer long-term safety data), clinicians should generally not use P-CABs as initial therapy for acid-related conditions in which clinical superiority has not been shown.
Best Practice Advice 2
Based on current costs in the United States, even modest clinical superiority of P-CABs over double-dose proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may not make P-CABs cost-effective as first-line therapy.
Best Practice Advice 3
Clinicians should generally not use P-CABs as first-line therapy for patients with uninvestigated heartburn symptoms or nonerosive reflux disease. Clinicians may use P-CABs in selected patients with documented acid-related reflux who fail therapy with twice-daily PPIs.
Best Practice Advice 4
Although there is currently insufficient evidence for clinicians to use P-CABs as first-line on-demand therapy for patients with heartburn symptoms who have previously responded to antisecretory therapy, their rapid onset of acid inhibition raises the possibility of their utility in this population.
Best Practice Advice 5
Clinicians should generally not use P-CABs as first-line therapy in patients with milder erosive esophagitis (EE) (Los Angeles classification of erosive esophagitis grade A/B EE). Clinicians may use P-CABs in selected patients with documented acid-related reflux who fail therapy with twice-daily PPIs.
Best Practice Advice 6
Clinicians may use P-CABs as a therapeutic option for the healing and maintenance of healing in patients with more severe EE (Los Angeles classification of erosive esophagitis grade C/D EE). However, given the markedly higher costs of the P-CAB presently available in the United States and the lack of randomized comparisons with double-dose PPIs, it is not clear that the benefits in endoscopic outcomes over standard-dose PPIs justify the routine use of P-CABs as first-line therapy.
Best Practice Advice 7
Clinicians should use P-CABs in place of PPIs in eradication regimens for most patients with H pylori infection.
Best Practice Advice 8
Clinicians should generally not use P-CABs as first-line therapy in the treatment or prophylaxis of peptic ulcer disease.
Best Practice Advice 9
Although there is currently insufficient evidence for clinicians to use P-CABs as first-line therapy in patients with bleeding gastroduodenal ulcers and high-risk stigmata, their rapid and potent acid inhibition raises the possibility of their utility in this population.},

	abstract = {Antireflux surgery anatomically restores the antireflux barrier and is a therapeutic option for proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease or PPI intolerance. Laparoscopic fundoplication is the standard antireflux surgery, though its popularity has declined due to concerns regarding wrap durability and adverse events. As the esophagogastric junction is an anatomically complex and dynamic area subject to mechanical stress, wraps are susceptible to disruption, herniation or slippage. Additionally, recreating an antireflux barrier to balance bidirectional bolus flow is challenging, and wraps may be too tight or too loose. Given these complexities it is not surprising that post-fundoplication symptoms and complications are common. Perioperative mortality rates range from 0.1 to 0.2\% and prolonged structural complications occur in up to 30\% of cases. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with a comprehensive retroflexed examination of the fundoplication and barium esophagram are the primary tests to assess for structural complications. Management hinges on differentiating complications that can be managed with medical and lifestyle optimization versus those that require surgical revision. Reoperation is best reserved for severe structural abnormalities and troublesome symptoms despite medical and endoscopic therapy given its increased morbidity and mortality. Though further data are needed, magnetic sphincter augmentation may be a safer alternative to fundoplication.},
